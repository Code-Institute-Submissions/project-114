# UX

## Aim of website

The websites goal is to present different options of Kitchen, Bathroom and Bedroom to the user accompanied with a brief description of each option. The layout is designed to be as simplistic as possible, to allow an easy understanding of the site to the user.

## Site creator aim

The aim is to consolidate my brief education in HTML and CSS, showcasing: internal and external links; image and font styling; basic site structure; responsiveness and interactivity; syntax and code structure etc.

## User aim

The user should be able to navigate the site with great ease and understand the variety of options 'home renovations' offers, identifying their different catagorizations and sub-catagories

## Site structure

The site consists of four pages (each clearly denoted by the navigation bars) each page follows the same basic structure, consisting of a main image to imediately grab the attention of the viewer while also giving an indication of what the page entails (a main image of a kitchen for the kitchen page etc) follwed by four sub images that act as an example for the options the user is allowed to choose from. A brief description outlines the various options' benefits and differences. finally, in the footer of each page there are links to external social media platforms.
